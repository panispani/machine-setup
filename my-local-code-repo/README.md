# Contents

- `Dockerfile`

- `src/`: Directory with all the code of the project

- `requirements.txt`:
Keep this file here and `pip freeze > requirements.txt` when you install something new

- `check_installation.py`:
Not needed, but you can run after you build & run the docker container the first time to make sure it all works correctly (run inside the container).
